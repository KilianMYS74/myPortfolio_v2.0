## Getting Started

I trully believe in OpenSource project, that is why this repository will stay public and free-to-use.

These instructions will get you a copy of the project up and running on your local machine for development and testing purposes.

You'll need [Git](https://git-scm.com) and [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/en/download/) (which comes with [npm](http://npmjs.com)) installed on your computer or use [Docker](https://www.docker.com/products/docker-desktop).

```
node@v10.16.0 or higher
npm@6.9.0 or higher
git@2.17.1 or higher
```
### Docker Commands

```
1) BUILD IMAGE : docker build -t developerfolio:latest .
2) RUN IMAGE: docker run -t -p 3000:3000 developerfolio:latest
```


## How To Use 

From your command line, clone and run developerFolio:

```bash
# Clone this repository
$ git clone git@github.com:KilianMYS74/myPortfolio_v2.0.git

# Go into the repository
$ cd myPortfolio_v2.0

# Install dependencies
$ npm install

#Start's development server
$ npm start
```

## Change and customize every section according to your need.

#### Personalize page content in `/src/portfolio.js` & modify it as per your need.

```javascript
/* Change this file to get your personal Portfolio */

// Your Summary And Greeting Section

import emoji from "react-easy-emoji";

const greeting = {
  /* Your Summary And Greeting Section */
  username: "Kilian Mayans",
  title: "Hi all, I'm Kilian",
  subTitle: emoji("A passionate Full-Stack Developer üöÄüñ•Ô∏è developing a passion of building Web and Mobile applications with JavaScript / Reactjs / Nodejs / React Native / Flutter and some other cool libraries and frameworks."),
  resumeLink: "https://www.dropbox.com/s/u2pi3x6czg9n40e/CV%20KILIAN%20MAYANS%20EPI%20v4_EN.pdf?dl=0"
};

// Your Social Media Link

const socialMediaLinks = {

  github: "https://github.com/KilianMYS74",
  linkedin: "https://www.linkedin.com/in/kilian-mayans/",
  gmail: "mayanskilian@gmail.com",
  // Support Gitlab, Facebook, Medium, Stackoverflow, Instagram and Twitter are also supported in the links!
};


const skillsSection = { ... }

const techStack = { ... }

const workExperience = { ... }

const openSource = { ... }

const bigProjects = { ... }

const achievementSection = { ... }

const blogSection = { ... }

const contactInfo = { ... }

const twitterDetails = { ... }

```

#### Using Emojis

For adding emoji üòÉ into the texts in `Portfolio.js`, use the `emoji()` function and pass the text you need as an argument. This would help in keeping emojis compatible across different browsers and platforms.

#### Adding Twitter Time line to your Page
Insert your Twitter username in `portfolio.js` to show your recent activity on your page.

```javascript
const twitterDetails = {
  userName : "Your Twitter Username"
};
```
Note: Don't use `@` symbol when adding username.

## Deployment
When you are done with the setup, you should host your website online.
